## Image Generators

###### The original intent of this project was to gain insight on the advancements of generative modeling through the means of image generation; to understand the advantages / pitfalls of the different methods and why.

The first model was simple pixel by pixel autoregressive generation. I trained a deep convolutional network to predict the next pixel on images of varying masks.
